"negative","no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise ."
"negative","even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy ."

"negative","more maudlin than sharp ."
"negative","this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic ."
"negative","it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype ."

"negative","episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight ."
"negative","the problem with all of this : it's not really funny ."
"negative","[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product ."
"negative","wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own ."
